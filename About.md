# Hello There! I'm you motion designer! Ready to shot some practical effects!

As you can see, I'm fan of Star Wars and thats one of the reasons why I do complex design. What does it mean? Mainly, I am motion & graphic designer for multimedia projects like TV series, commercials but also I do brand design or product design.

But what about my work? You can see my work everywhere... For example we (me and team) did the biggest commercial in covid-19 for the biggest european pool company, ALBIXON. Do you like Czech films? No? Give them a try! You should see one of them, [Uzly a pomeranƒçe](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9258012/). There are my coding, motion design and VFX skills. Or just look at the one of Czech musician, Marek Ztracen√Ω and [his music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVS7qJakzSI).

That was only my basic work, but what is there anything other? Of course! For my projects (without external agency), I usually do practical effects and I mix them with visual effects and motion design for the best visual experience. You know, CGI just look fake!
