# Thesis

## Introduction
As you know, I'm a little nerdy. And that's why, before the end of last school year, I came up with the idea of creating a new user interface for AI generating images.

#### Why?
if you're asking why, it's simple. Although there are many user interfaces for various forms of AI, but none are made for visual design professionals.

#### Summer and the beginning...
Last summer an article was written about my planned thesis and there was **no turning back**.

So after that, I started working on my thesis and thinking about how I could bring a tool to professionals that they can use.

#### But I am Graphic Designer
There were two things that were in the way - the fact that **I'm a graphic designer and not a programmer**. And that there is **not enough time** to create a tool that can be used in a similar way to Photoshop, Affinity Photo or popular Canva.

So I decided to base my tool on web technologies that I understand myself. This also allowed me to make a multi-platform application that can be run on macOS, Windows and Linux.
