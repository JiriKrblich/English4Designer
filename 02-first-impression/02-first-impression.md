Hi! My name is Jiří Krblich and I'm generalist in visual design, but mainly graphic & motion designer for multimedia projects like movie, commercials or television.

It's all started in my 10 when I started learning the basic of Graphic Design with old creative suite on eMac.

But something happened a I realised that i need change so I gone to high school where I can study electronics. It's maybe sounds unimportant but it is!

At the same time I started doing graphic and motion design at the VFX studio based in Prague. And we did some amazing things, mainly practical and animatronics effects!
