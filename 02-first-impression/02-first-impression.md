### Hi! My name is Jiří Krblich and I'm generalist in visual design!

... but mainly graphic & motion designer for multimedia projects like movie, commercials or television.

But what it means? 

### How I started?

It's all started in my 10 when I started learning the basic of Graphic Design with old creative suite on eMac.

But something happened a I realised that i need change so I gone to high school where I can study electronics. It's maybe sounds unimportant but it is!

### My first graphic and motion works

At the same time I started doing graphic and motion design at the VFX studio based in Prague. And we did some amazing things, mainly practical and animatronics effects!

### What about now?

Sadly, we splited up, so I continue in the practical effects and product design!

At the time, when AI wasn't so popular, I used it for music video:![[KNYY_â_Fantasy_(Trailer).mp4]]

Or I just experiment! Like with this music video for artist called KNYY, where the main actor is hand:![[pasted-image.png]]

Is it this projects too boring? Maybe. And I'm sometimes bored of my work too! So I decided to design my own typeface – Mluvka! (In czech: Someone who talks too much)

And where you can see this typeface? For example in the TV show called Extraktoři by TV Nova!




### A that's me! "only" designer!
