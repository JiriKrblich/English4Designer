# Hi! My name is Jiří Krblich and I'm generalist in visual design!

![[/02-first-impression/static/me.jpg]]

... but mainly graphic & motion designer for multimedia projects like movie, commercials or brading.

*But what does that actually mean?*

### How I started?

It's all started in my 10 when I started learning the basic of Graphic Design with old creative suite on eMac.

But something happened a I realised that i need change so I gone to high school where I can study electronics. It's maybe sounds unimportant but it is!

### My first graphic and motion works

At the same time I started doing graphic and motion design at the VFX studio based in Prague. And we did some amazing things, mainly practical and animatronics effects!

Below this text is a example project where we used practical effects and electronic knowledge to create a mask that projects animated videos, is controllable remotely and acts as a mascot in filmed videos where it replaces CGI.

### University

I started studying at VŠKK because I already had some real experience with graphic design and advertising. At the same time I continued to work on commercial projects and advertising campaigns.

I thought I wouldn't learn anything at school, but I really fell in love with typography... but more on that later.
### What about now?

Sadly, our tweak team has split up, so I continue in the practical effects and product design!

This is a project we are creating together with the Czech School without Borders, London. We are trying to bring Czech children a better way of learning than just watching a presentation. We have therefore devised a short animated film using elements of practical and visual effects, along with animated illustrations.

Back in the days when AI was an unfamiliar concept I had already tried it and due to time and financial constraints I decided to use it to create illustrations for the animated music video *Fantasy.*

Sometimes I simply experiment, in this example of my work I also use hand as the main actor in a music video that moves the whole world. And as in my other works, I combine practical and visual effects.

Are these projects too boring? I agree! I get bored sometimes too. That's why in my spare time I'm developing my own font called Mluvka. In Czech, a Mluvka is someone who talks too much...

The point of this font was simple, to create a font that I can use in animations without having to pay for expensive special video licenses.

And where you can see Mluvka? For example in the TV show called *Extraktoři* by TV Nova!

### And that's me! "only" designer!
