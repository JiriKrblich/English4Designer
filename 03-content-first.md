# Hello There! I'm you designer!

As you can see, I'm fan of Star Wars and thats one of the reasons why I do complex design. What does it mean? Mainly, I am motion designer for multimedia projects like TV shows, commercials but also I do brand design or product design.

But what about my work? You can see my work everywhere. For example we (me and team) did the biggest commercial in covid-19 for the biggest european pool company, ALBIXON. Do you like Czech films? No? Give them a try! You can see one of them, Uzly a pomeranče. There are my coding, motion design and VFX skills. Or just look at the one of Czech musician, Marek Ztracený what I did with FILMZLICINCOMPANY production.

That was only my basic work, but what is there anything other? Of course! For my projects (without external agency), I usually do practical effects and I mix them with visual effects and motion design for the best visual experience. You know, CGI just look fake!
